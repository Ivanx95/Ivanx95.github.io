					<p>
						I'm a regular  developer, I have used the hats of Backend developer, desktop developer and Frontend developer but mostly my happy place is Backend. 

						I like Frontend developer because makes very easy to distribute apps thru the web rather than developing an installer or publishing my work to application stores, but sadly I haven't taken my time to learn a Frontend framework.
